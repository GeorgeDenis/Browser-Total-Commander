# Browser-Total-Commander

WebCommander is a web-based file management tool inspired by the classic Total Commander, reimagined for the modern web. Built using Python, Flask, and the trinity of front-end development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers a seamless and intuitive interface to manage your files directly within your browser. With dual-panel functionality, you can view and organize two separate directories or partitions simultaneously.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
-  Python (version 3.6 or higher)
-  Flask (latest version)
-  A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

## Setting Up
To set up the WebCommander, follow these steps:
-  Open the directory
-  Set up a Python virtual environment and activate it.
-  Run the main file with any Python IDE
  
## Features
-  Dual-Panel Interface: Two independent panels to display different directories for efficient file management.
-  File Operations: Create new files and directories, rename, delete, or edit text files with ease.
-  Copy & Move: Transfer files and folders from one panel to another with a simple drag-and-drop action or through buttons.
-  Information Display: View detailed information about your files and folders, such as extension, size, and modification date.
-  Text File Editing: Open and edit text files directly within the app with the built-in text editor.
